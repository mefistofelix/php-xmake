# Project Guidance

## Goal

Build PHP on Windows with a minimal `xmake.lua`. The finished build must be static and use parallel compilation.

Keep this file and `TODO.md` clear, organized, written in English, and synchronized with the implementation.

## Supported Environment

- Support Windows only for now; do not add cross-platform branches prematurely.
- Prefer relative paths throughout the build.
- Prefer Xmake built-in placeholders and platform/toolchain queries for architecture-dependent values such as `x64`, Windows paths, type sizes, and compiler properties.
- The supported workflow is:

  ```text
  xmake prepare
  xmake
  ```

- `xmake prepare` is run manually before the main build and must be idempotent. It downloads and extracts source trees, prebuilt dependencies, and required external tools.

## Target Model

- Keep `xmake.lua` primarily declarative: it should consist of Xmake configuration, target declarations, and one target-specific `cb` callback function per target.
- Do not add arbitrary Lua helper functions, tables, aliases, or variables. Introduce Lua state only when an Xmake API requires it and no direct declarative expression is practical; keep such state local to the owning task or target callback.
- A target's `cb` function is its single imperative entry point for configuration and code generation. Do not split target preparation across extra Lua functions.
- Give every library dependency its own static-library target.
- PHP extensions are part of the main PHP target; do not create a separate target for each extension.
- Add source files with the broadest safe patterns, ideally at dependency or PHP-tree scope.
- Enable unity builds with the largest safe compilation groups, splitting groups only where symbol collisions or other compiler constraints require it.
- Build the project incrementally, one target at a time, starting with dependencies and ending with the complete PHP target.
- Keep only the current priority target active during focused build/debug cycles. Use `set_enabled(false)` to remove unrelated or unfinished targets completely. Use `set_default(false)` when a target must remain available for an explicit build or as a dependency but should not join the default build. Re-enable a target when it becomes the priority or a dependency of the priority target.

## Code Generation

- Run every required code-generation step from a callback supplied by the `cb` rule.
- Use exactly one target-specific callback per target. Attach it as file configuration to the single most appropriate source entry for that target; that callback owns all generated sources, headers, and configuration files for the target.
- Do not create a separate callback for each generated file.
- If a callback needs an external executable such as Perl, Bison, RE2C, or the Windows message compiler, make that executable available during `xmake prepare`.
- If a callback needs an executable built by this project, such as `minilua` or `gen_ir_fold_hash`, build/invoke its Xmake target programmatically from the callback using Xmake built-ins.
- Generate C configuration headers and their defines/parameters in the owning target callback. Use Xmake detection APIs for platform properties instead of hard-coding them.
- Keep source and generated paths relative. Use Xmake placeholders for platform-dependent path segments where possible.
- Document every code-generation action in the inventory in this file, including owner target, input, output, tool, arguments, assembly use, and intertwined dependencies.

## Documentation and Progress

- This file is the build-policy, target, and code-generation reference. Keep its inventories synchronized with `xmake.lua`.
- `TODO.md` is the live implementation plan. Update completed work, the next target, blockers, and validation status whenever the build changes.
- Do not claim a target is working until it has been built successfully.

## Validation and Git Workflow

- Commit all intended source and documentation changes before every Xmake configure or build test.
- After a test, record the result in `TODO.md`; commit that update before the next Xmake test.
- Keep generated files, downloaded sources, tool binaries, caches, and build output ignored.
- Treat warnings and accidental undeclared inputs as build issues to investigate rather than silently accepting them.

## Current Target Inventory

| Target | Build state | Kind | Source inputs | Output | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `zlib` | Enabled (current priority) | Static library | `in/deps/zlib/*.c` | `out/zlib.lib` | First compression dependency | Four-file unity batches; inflate sources isolated; rebuild pending |
| `minilua` | Disabled | Binary | `in/php-src/ext/opcache/jit/ir/dynasm/minilua.c` | `out/minilua.exe` | Runs DynASM for the PHP JIT IR emitter | Defined; build validation pending |
| `gen_ir_fold_hash` | Disabled | Binary | `in/php-src/ext/opcache/jit/ir/gen_ir_fold_hash.c` | `out/gen_ir_fold_hash.exe` | Generates the JIT IR fold hash header | Defined; build validation pending |
| `php` | Disabled | Object prototype | `in/php-src/Zend/zend.c`, `in/php-src/Zend/asm/*_xmm_x86_64_ms_masm.asm` | `out/` | Becomes the static PHP build after dependency, configuration, codegen, and source integration | Prototype only; callback is a placeholder |

The `prepare` task fetches dependencies. Each library must receive its own Xmake static-library target as it is integrated; downloaded or prebuilt archives are not yet build targets.

The zlib target keeps `infback.c`, `inffast.c`, and `inflate.c` out of unity batches. `gzwrite.c` exposes a `COPY` macro through `gzguts.h`, while `inflate.h` declares an enum member with the same name; the inflate implementation headers also assume separate translation units. The remaining sources stay in four-file unity batches.

## PHP Code-generation Inventory

All paths below are relative to `in/php-src` unless prefixed with `out/`. Entries marked "planned" reproduce the known PHP generation commands but are not yet wired into the `php` target callback.

The PHP target also assembles `Zend/asm/*_xmm_x86_64_ms_masm.asm` with MSVC-compatible assembly flags. Broader PHP and extension source inclusion, static linking, and unity-build grouping remain to be implemented.
